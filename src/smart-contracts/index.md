# Contracting Engine
The Contracting engine enables contracts to be written in a subset of Python designed for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts with ease and efficiency. It makes blockchain development as intuitive and accessible as possible, leveraging the simplicity of Python to offer a seamless smart contract development experience. <br/><br/>

Contracting simplifies the process of creating, testing, and deploying smart contracts by providing a Pythonic interface to the Xian blockchain. Whether you're a beginner in blockchain technology or an experienced developer looking to streamline your smart contract development workflow, Contracting is designed to enhance your productivity and make blockchain development accessible to a wider audience.

## Features

- **Pure Python**: Write smart contracts with the simplicity and elegance of Python.
- **Integrated Testing Tools**: Test your contracts with built-in frameworks that simulate blockchain environments.
- **Easy Deployment**: Deploy your contracts to the blockchain with the wallet, or by dropping the contract file in a message to our Telegram bot.
- **Modular Design**: Each smart contract is a separate file, or module that can be imported and used by other contracts. This makes it easy to reuse and share contracts as modules to build complex decentralized applications.
